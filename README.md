# AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program (Udacity)

This repository is the collection of projects that are part of the nanodegree program requirement.
The nanodegree program is 3-month self-paced certification program which was taken between 12/2022 - 03/2023. The program consists of 4 chapters and 1 capstone project. Each chapter consists of concept videos and coding exercises and quizzes and a trying-all-together project.

____

## [1. Prediction of Bike demand using AutoGluon]()

### Project goal:

To predict [bike demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand) using automl model `AutoGluon`. The section includes data exploration and hyperparameter tuning.

### Deliverables:
1. Project report ([`Bike Sharing Demand Prediction.md`]())
1. Code notebook ([`Prediction Using AutoGluon.ipynb`]())
1. Code notebook's html ([`Prediction Using AutoGluon.html`]())

____
## [2. Building ML Workflow on Amazon Sagamaker]()

### Project goal:

To predict motorcycle and bike image from [`CIFAR-100`](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-100-python.tar.gz) dataset using Amazon's `image-classication-model`. The goal is to practice:
1. Load and upload data from and to S3
1. Train an estimator
1. Deploy the model through Endpoint
1. Setup Lambda function
1. Create Step function to demonstrate serverless workflow

### Deliverables:
1. Code notebook ([`Project2-ML_Workflow.ipynb`]())
1. Code notebook's html ([`Project2-ML_Workflow.html`]())
1. Lambda function [scripts]()
1. Screenshots of Step function workflow

____
## [3. Image Classification using AWS Sagemaker]()

### Project goal:

To predict dog bread from image dataset using pretrained model through Sagemaker's script mode. The goal is to practice:
1. Create scripts to train and debug the model
1. Learn to use pretrained models
1. Hyperparameter tuning
1. Use Debugger and profiler
1. Deploy the best model
1. Package the model as docker container

### Deliverables:
1. Code notebook ([`Project2-ML_Workflow.ipynb`]())
1. Code notebook's html ([`Project2-ML_Workflow.html`]())
1. [`Readme.md`]() file of the project
1. Screenshots of successfully trained hyperparameter tuning and model training processes
